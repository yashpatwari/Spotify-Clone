import { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from "react";

export const StateContext = createContext();

export const StateProvider = ({ initialState, reducer, children }) => (
  <StateContext.Provider value={useReducer(reducer, initialState)}>

export const useStateProvider = () => useContext(StateContext); // this makes the code very useful and also reduces the overuse of the props making the readabilty good.
